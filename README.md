Submitted by: **Emanuel Warzel**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**PokeAPI Recycle View** is an android app that **displays a list of 20 random pokemon using the PokeAPI, with name and some basic stats**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **emojis here**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient

- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [ ] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [ ] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

## Notes
